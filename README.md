Hi and welcome to my GitHub Data Analytics repository! Within this folder is a whole variety of some of the different projects, assignments, and certifications I have completed as part of my six course data analytics track here at DeSales University. Throughout the track we covered a whole variety of different topics ranging anywhere from AI safety, predictive analytics, RPA solutions, to simply improving and testing excel skills, and more. I found this track to be extremely valuable in advancing my understanding of the world of data, the enormous impact it plays on companies, and developing some of the necessary skills to be able work within this space. Listed below, and within this repository, are a few of the projects that I had the privilege of working on throughout the last two years. I hope you enjoy.
